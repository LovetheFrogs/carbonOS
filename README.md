# carbonOS
A standalone x86 operating system developed according to [The Little Book About OS Development](https://littleosbook.github.io/) by Erik Helin & Adam Renberg. The implementations of book's chapters are divided into separate branches.

In addition, I've written a series of blog articles on Medium that walk you through the process step by step. The URLs to relevant git branches, along with their related medium articles, are listed below.
